adamveld12: I want you to help me design a model context protocol server with the following features:

- record_meeting: start recording a meeting's audio.

- finish_recording: stop recording a meeting's audio. Returns the path to an audio file with the recording.

- recording_status: the status, if we're recording or not




First let's talk about the tech stack and tools.

- I want to use Typescript and Electron

- I want to use the screen sharing and user media APIs to capture the audio output.

An LLM client should be able to use this tool to start a screen share. Then when prompted to stop, the recording should finish and be saved to an audio file (.wav) and the file path should be returned to the LLM so it can use it later.



I want to use STDIO as the transport for the MCP server.

I also want to be able to run this using NPX, like most locally installed MCP servers are used.


For the very first step, I would like you to help me design and flesh out this application and it's features.
We should have a very detailed and explicity application spec to follow, such that we could hand it to a developer without any additional context and they would be able to build this without any bugs or missing features.

Workspace: Sure, here's a proposed directory structure for a TypeScript Electron MCP server:

Create Workspace...

adamveld12: Lets wait for a moment, can you describe for me how you designed this application conceptually step by step?

GitHub Copilot: # Audio Recording MCP Server: Conceptual Design

I approached the design of this Model Context Protocol (MCP) server methodically:

## 1. Core Architecture Components

- **MCP Server Layer**: Handles the protocol communication via STDIO
- **Recording Engine**: Manages audio capture through Electron APIs
- **Command Handlers**: Implements the three required functions
- **Transport Layer**: Manages bidirectional STDIO communication

## 2. Application Flow

1. **Initialization**: NPX launches the Electron application
2. **Communication**: Server listens on STDIO for incoming commands from LLM
3. **Command Processing**: When requests arrive, they route to appropriate handlers
4. **Recording Management**:
   - `record_meeting`: Initializes audio capture via Electron's media APIs
   - `finish_recording`: Stops capture, exports WAV file, returns path
   - `recording_status`: Returns current recording state

## 3. Technical Considerations

- **Electron** provides window management and media capture capabilities
- **TypeScript** ensures type safety across the application
- **STDIO Transport** requires careful buffer handling for reliable communication
- **Audio Processing** needs proper stream management and file export utilities

## 4. Modular Design

I separated concerns between protocol handling, audio capture, and command implementation to allow for easier maintenance and testing of individual components.

The directory structure reflects this separation with clear boundaries between the MCP protocol implementation and the underlying audio recording functionality.

adamveld12: Lets step by step break down and understand the Technical considerations and requirements first

GitHub Copilot: # Technical Considerations and Requirements Breakdown

## 1. Electron Framework

- **Window Management Requirements**:
  - Need a minimal or hidden window for background operation
  - Must maintain process even when not in focus
  - Should handle proper application lifecycle events

- **Media Capture Specifics**:
  - Use `desktopCapturer` API to access system audio streams
  - Need permissions management for accessing audio devices
  - Must handle both microphone and system audio capture options
  - Need to support common audio formats and sampling rates

- **Cross-Platform Considerations**:
  - Audio APIs differ between Windows, macOS, and Linux
  - File path handling must be OS-appropriate
  - Temporary directory access differs by platform

## 2. TypeScript Implementation

- **Type Definitions Required**:
  - Interface definitions for all MCP commands and responses
  - Type safety for audio stream handling
  - Proper typing for Electron and Node.js APIs

- **Build Configuration**:
  - Target ECMAScript version compatible with Electron's Node.js version
  - Module resolution for Node.js environment
  - Source maps for debugging

## 3. STDIO Transport Layer

- **Protocol Format**:
  - Line-delimited JSON messages
  - Command structure following MCP specification
  - Standard error handling patterns

- **Stream Handling**:
  - Non-blocking I/O operations
  - Buffer management for partial messages
  - Proper encoding/decoding (utf-8)

## 4. Audio Recording Functionality

- **Stream Management**:
  - Audio data buffering
  - Sample rate and format consistency
  - Stream termination handling

- **File Output**:
  - WAV file format implementation
  - Metadata inclusion (timestamp, duration)
  - Atomic file operations for reliability
  - Unique filename generation

## 5. NPX Distribution Requirements

- **Package Configuration**:
  - Binary executable entry point
  - Proper dependencies
  - Installation scripts
  - Path resolution for packaged resources

Would you like me to dive deeper into any specific aspect of these technical requirements?

adamveld12: Can we research the desktopCapturer API? how does that work

GitHub Copilot: # Understanding Electron's `desktopCapturer` API

The `desktopCapturer` API is a key part of Electron that allows us to capture audio and video from system sources. Here's how it works:

## Basic Functionality

```typescript
import { desktopCapturer } from 'electron';

// Get available capture sources (windows, screens)
const sources = await desktopCapturer.getSources({
  types: ['window', 'screen'],
  thumbnailSize: { width: 0, height: 0 } // No thumbnails needed for audio
});

// Choose a source to capture from
const source = sources[0]; // First available source

// Use with WebRTC's getUserMedia API
const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
  audio: {
    mandatory: {
      chromeMediaSource: 'desktop',
      chromeMediaSourceId: source.id
    }
  },
  video: false // Audio only
});
```

## Audio Capture Specifics

- **System Audio Capture**:
  - Windows: Supported via `chromeMediaSource: 'desktop'`
  - macOS: Often requires additional virtual audio drivers
  - Linux: Support varies by distribution

- **Microphone Capture**:
  - Requires separate getUserMedia call with `{audio: true}`
  - Can be mixed with system audio using Web Audio API

## Platform Challenges

- **Windows**: Most straightforward for system audio capture
- **macOS**: May require virtual audio routing solutions (like BlackHole)
- **Linux**: Generally requires PulseAudio/PipeWire configuration

## Permissions

- Electron apps have access by default (no browser permission prompts)
- System-level permissions may still apply (especially on macOS)
- No indicator shown to users that recording is happening (unlike browsers)

Would you like me to further detail any specific aspect of implementing this for our MCP server?

adamveld12: We need to be able to list the sources and allow the user to pick which application they would like to record audio from. How can we do this with the API?

GitHub Copilot: # Implementing Source Selection for Audio Recording

You can offer source selection through the `desktopCapturer` API by following these steps:

## 1. List Available Sources

```typescript
import { desktopCapturer } from 'electron';

async function listAudioSources() {
  // Get all window and screen sources
  const sources = await desktopCapturer.getSources({
    types: ['window', 'screen'],
    // Small thumbnails help identify applications
    thumbnailSize: { width: 150, height: 150 }
  });

  // Format for easier consumption
  return sources.map(source => ({
    id: source.id,
    name: source.name,
    thumbnail: source.thumbnail.toDataURL()
  }));
}
```

## 2. Add a New MCP Command for Source Selection

```typescript
// Add a new command to list sources
async function handleListSources() {
  const sources = await listAudioSources();
  return { sources };
}
```

## 3. Modify the `record_meeting` Command to Accept Source ID

```typescript
async function handleRecordMeeting(params: any) {
  const { sourceId } = params;

  if (!sourceId) {
    // If no sourceId provided, return error or list of sources
    throw new Error('Source ID required. Use list_sources command first.');
  }

  // Start recording with the specified source
  const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
    audio: {
      mandatory: {
        chromeMediaSource: 'desktop',
        chromeMediaSourceId: sourceId
      }
    },
    video: false
  });

  // Start recording with this stream
  startRecordingFromStream(stream);

  return { status: 'recording' };
}
```

## 4. Usage Flow

1. LLM calls `list_sources` command
2. MCP server returns list of applications/windows
3. LLM presents choices to user and gets selection
4. LLM calls `record_meeting` with the selected `sourceId`

## Important Considerations

- Not all sources produce audio, but the API doesn't explicitly indicate which ones do
- Source IDs are temporary and change when applications restart
- On macOS, system audio capture often requires additional virtual audio drivers
- Consider adding a "system audio" option that uses default system audio

Would you like me to expand on any part of this implementation?

adamveld12: We can actually detect which applications are producing audio with an interesting method.

For video conferencing clients, they have a certain number of active UDP connections when idle vs when in a meeting. We can use these unique connection "fingerprints" to determine if certain applications are performing video conferencing.

We can use this information to filter the list of potential sources down.

Can you expand on this idea by giving a step by step breakdown of how we might do this in code?

GitHub Copilot: # Detecting Active Video Conference Applications Using Network Connections

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Create a Network Connection Analyzer

```typescript
// network-analyzer.ts
import { exec } from 'child_process';
import { promisify } from 'util';

const execAsync = promisify(exec);

interface ConnectionInfo {
  pid: number;
  localAddress: string;
  foreignAddress: string;
  state: string;
  protocol: string;
}

export async function getUdpConnections(): Promise<ConnectionInfo[]> {
  // Platform-specific commands
  let command = '';
  switch (process.platform) {
    case 'win32':
      command = 'netstat -ano -p UDP';
      break;
    case 'darwin': // macOS
      command = 'lsof -i UDP -n -P';
      break;
    case 'linux':
      command = 'ss -pu';
      break;
    default:
      throw new Error(`Unsupported platform: ${process.platform}`);
  }

  const { stdout } = await execAsync(command);
  return parseConnectionOutput(stdout, process.platform);
}

function parseConnectionOutput(output: string, platform: string): ConnectionInfo[] {
  // Platform-specific parsing logic
  // This would extract connection information including PIDs
  // Simplified example - actual implementation would be more complex
  // ...

  return []; // Parsed connections
}
```

### 2. Map Processes to Application Sources

```typescript
// process-source-mapper.ts
import { desktopCapturer } from 'electron';
import { exec } from 'child_process';
import { promisify } from 'util';

const execAsync = promisify(exec);

interface SourceWithProcess {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  pid?: number;
  thumbnail: string;
}

export async function getSourcesWithProcessInfo(): Promise<SourceWithProcess[]> {
  // Get all sources
  const sources = await desktopCapturer.getSources({
    types: ['window', 'screen'],
    thumbnailSize: { width: 150, height: 150 }
  });

  // Get window-to-process mappings (platform specific)
  const windowProcessMap = await getWindowProcessMap();

  // Map sources to processes
  return sources.map(source => ({
    id: source.id,
    name: source.name,
    pid: windowProcessMap[source.id] || undefined,
    thumbnail: source.thumbnail.toDataURL()
  }));
}

async function getWindowProcessMap(): Promise<Record<string, number>> {
  // Platform-specific way to get window handles and their associated PIDs
  // On Windows: could use PowerShell or Windows API through node-ffi
  // On macOS: could use AppleScript or Swift CLI tool
  // Simplified example:

  return {}; // Map of window IDs to process IDs
}
```

### 3. Define Conferencing App Fingerprints

```typescript
// conferencing-detector.ts
interface ConferencingFingerprint {
  name: string;
  idleUdpConnections: [number, number]; // [min, max] range
  activeUdpConnections: [number, number]; // [min, max] range
  domains?: string[]; // Common domains in connections
}

const KNOWN_FINGERPRINTS: ConferencingFingerprint[] = [
  {
    name: 'Zoom',
    idleUdpConnections: [0, 5],
    activeUdpConnections: [10, 100],
    domains: ['zoom.us']
  },
  {
    name: 'Microsoft Teams',
    idleUdpConnections: [0, 3],
    activeUdpConnections: [8, 50],
    domains: ['teams.microsoft.com', 'teams.live.com']
  },
  {
    name: 'Google Meet',
    idleUdpConnections: [0, 2],
    activeUdpConnections: [5, 40],
    domains: ['meet.google.com', 'meetings.googleapis.com']
  }
];
```

### 4. Analyze and Identify Active Conferencing Apps

```typescript
// conferencing-detector.ts (continued)
import { getUdpConnections } from './network-analyzer';
import { getSourcesWithProcessInfo } from './process-source-mapper';

export async function detectActiveConferencingSources() {
  // Get all UDP connections
  const connections = await getUdpConnections();

  // Get all sources with process IDs
  const sourcesWithPids = await getSourcesWithProcessInfo();

  // Count UDP connections per process
  const processConnectionCounts: Record<number, number> = {};
  connections.forEach(conn => {
    if (conn.protocol === 'UDP') {
      processConnectionCounts[conn.pid] = (processConnectionCounts[conn.pid] || 0) + 1;
    }
  });

  // Analyze each source to see if it matches conferencing patterns
  const sourcesWithConfStatus = sourcesWithPids.map(source => {
    if (!source.pid) return { ...source, isConferencing: false, confidence: 0 };

    const connectionCount = processConnectionCounts[source.pid] || 0;

    // Check if this matches any known fingerprints
    for (const fingerprint of KNOWN_FINGERPRINTS) {
      if (
        source.name.includes(fingerprint.name) &&
        connectionCount >= fingerprint.activeUdpConnections[0] &&
        connectionCount <= fingerprint.activeUdpConnections[1]
      ) {
        // Calculate confidence based on how well it matches
        const midActive = (fingerprint.activeUdpConnections[0] + fingerprint.activeUdpConnections[1]) / 2;
        const distance = Math.abs(connectionCount - midActive);
        const range = fingerprint.activeUdpConnections[1] - fingerprint.activeUdpConnections[0];
        const confidence = 1 - (distance / range);

        return {
          ...source,
          isConferencing: true,
          confidence: confidence,
          connectionCount
        };
      }
    }

    return { ...source, isConferencing: false, confidence: 0, connectionCount };
  });

  // Sort by conferencing status and confidence
  return sourcesWithConfStatus.sort((a, b) => {
    if (a.isConferencing && !b.isConferencing) return -1;
    if (!a.isConferencing && b.isConferencing) return 1;
    return (b.confidence || 0) - (a.confidence || 0);
  });
}
```

### 5. Integrate with MCP Command

```typescript
// commands/list-sources.ts
import { detectActiveConferencingSources } from '../utils/conferencing-detector';

export async function handleListSources() {
  const sources = await detectActiveConferencingSources();

  // Group sources by likely relevance
  const result = {
    likelyConferencingSources: sources.filter(s => s.isConferencing),
    otherSources: sources.filter(s => !s.isConferencing),
  };

  return result;
}
```

## Key Challenges and Considerations

1. **Permission Requirements**: Accessing network information requires elevated permissions on some platforms
2. **Platform Differences**: The implementation details vary significantly between Windows, macOS, and Linux
3. **Process Mapping**: Reliably mapping
